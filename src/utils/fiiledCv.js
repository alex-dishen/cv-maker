               development. But software development is not "just a job" for me,
               it's offered an engaging challenge to continually learn and
               improve my skills in creating high-quality software.  It  became
               a full-fledged passion that only gets more exciting with time.
               Below you'll find projects I've completed that showcase my skills
               and general background in developing software.`
